### elliottprogrammer Level-Up game

Sort of like a game. Built with JavaScript and the HTML Canvas API.

Jump the elliottprogrammer cartoon character (an animated sprite) up the various platform levels.

Originally I built this for my [Dev Portfolio Website](https://elliottprogrammer.com).

I rote a blog post about it here: [🕹️ Always Leveling Up: Building My Own Mini Game (and My Skills) as a Full-Stack Engineer](https://blog.elliottprogrammer.com/always-leveling-up-building-my-own-mini-game-and-my-skills-as-a-full-stack-engineer/)
